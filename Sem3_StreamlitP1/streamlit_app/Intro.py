st.markdown("""
## Introduction
Our seminar application is designed as an interactive learning tool to explore data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model evaluation. The app is divided into six sections, each covering a fundamental aspect of data preparation and model building:

1. **Handling missing values, standardization, and normalization**  
2. **Encoding categorical variables and handling outliers**  
3. **Feature engineering and variable selection**  
4. **Data visualization and correlation analysis**  
5. **Train-test split and machine learning models**  
6. **Model evaluation (decision trees and random forests)**  

Each section includes theoretical explanations and practical implementations using Python and key libraries such as **pandas, scikit-learn, and Plotly**.
